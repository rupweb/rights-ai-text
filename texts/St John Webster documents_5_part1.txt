6th February 2013
Dear Sirs,
WITHOUT PREJUDICE SAVE AS TO COSTS
Webster v Ashcroft (1) and Others
HC 09 C 01570
Our client's claim is of course listed for a five day Trial from 13th February 2013 onwards.
Although our client has previously made formal offers to settle on a "Without Prejudice Save
As To Costs" basis, his offers have been rejected by your Clients, with no counter-offers
whatsoever having been made by them.
We are now writing to put forward a fresh Offer, in the hope that a settlement can
this late stage - be reached, and the costs of Trial thereby be saved.
-
even at
Having received from you on the morning of Monday 4th February 2013 copies of documents
from the 2005 Will file of John Shirley & Co., it is clear that the First Defendant ought to
have informed the Second Defendant either before or during the appointment on 24th May
2006 at which Valerie signed her Disputed 2006 Will, that she had been told by Mrs. Booth
less than five months before the appointment that (i) Mrs. Booth had concerns about
Valerie's "ability to make any alterations to her will" and that (ii) Mrs. Booth had already
confirmed in the Summer of 2005 that she didn't think Valerie "was capable of giving proper
Will instructions", and when the First Defendant asked whether Valerie could make a
simple codicil reducing pecuniary legacies of Â£1,000 by half - that (iii) Mrs. Booth "had
concerns about her even doing that".
Page 1 of 4
Page 95 of 140
No reference whatsoever has been made by the First Defendant in her Witness Statement to
that discussion on 5th January 2006, and the Court will presumably learn during the course of
cross-examination whether she did indeed so inform the Second Defendant and/or the Fourth
Defendant. In the circumstances, one or more of the First, Second and Fourth Defendants
is/are likely to be heavily criticised by the Court.
Furthermore, it is clear that the John Shirley & Co. file has been in the "control", within the
meaning of CPR 31.8 (2) (b), of the Second Defendant for well over two years, namely since
his appointment on 9th July 2010 as Administrator pending determination of our Client's
claim. He should therefore at that stage - and arguably earlier - have taken the steps which he
apparently only embarked upon late last year, namely to obtain the relevant file from John
Shirley & Co. and provide disclosure of it, as provided for in the Order dated 22nd March
2010.
However, what actually has happened is that both of your Clients have continued to propound
the Disputed 2006 Will, and indeed they continue to do so notwithstanding the contents of the
John Shirley & Co. file and the evidence of Mrs. Booth. Had your Clients accepted that the
Disputed 2006 Will was not valid we believe that there would have been a very good
prospect of a settlement at a much earlier stage, and a considerable amount of costs would
thereby have been saved.
In a letter dated 8th November 2012 we also repeatedly raised our concerns as to the conflict
of interest between the First and Second Defendants, in consequence of which Mr Penley and
his firm (Penleys LLP) will be the subject of negligence proceedings arising out of one more
of the following:
1. His failure to act in accordance with Antony's wishes, intentions and instructions in
1992
2. His failure to act in accordance with the wishes and intentions - and indeed the
repeated specific instructions of Valerie in relation to The Priory and the
Agricultural Land
3. His failure whilst dealing with the administration of Antony's estate to take account
of the use and occupation by Valentine and Jennifer of the Priory and of the
Agricultural Land, and the resulting lower value of Antony's net estate
4. The taking of instructions in relation to the Disputed 2006 Will
5. His failure to seek instructions from Valerie - as opposed to Virginia and / or Rory, as
to the making of a fresh Will following Valentine's death, and
6. His failure whilst dealing with the administration of Valerie's estate to take account of
the use and occupation by Valentine and/or Jennifer and/or Valentine's estate of the
Priory and of the Agricultural Land, and of the claims being made in these
proceedings, and the resulting lower value of Valerie's net estate.
Page 2 of 4
Page 96 of 140
In our most recent letter of 1st February 2013 we again raised the concern that one or more
findings will be made against Mr Penley and his firm of which it is incumbent on him to
report the matter to his Professional Indemnity Insurers.
The draft Minute of Order therefore provides for the Second Defendant to resign as a Trustee
of Antony's Will Trust and be replaced by the Third Defendant. This is broadly consistent
with the following:
-
1. Valentine's request of 8th July 2005 attested by Valerie and the First Defendant
2. Valentine's request of 16th July 2005 attested by the Fourth Defendant
3. The Third Defendant's Appointment of 31st July 2005
4. Master Bragge's Order of 22nd September 2010 to join the Third Defendant into the
proceedings
5. The Third Defendant's continuing residency at the Priory and Taunton Trees
6. Valentine's Will
The Third Defendant replacing the Second Defendant as a trustee of Antony's Will Trust
alongside Virginia potentially indemnifies the Second Defendant in respect of negligence
proceedings that could otherwise be brought by our Client and/or any of the other Defendants
in respect of Antony's wishes, intentions and instructions in 1992.
In all the circumstances, our Client offers to settle his claim on the basis set out in the
attached and enclosed draft Minute of Order. As you will see, it provides for the First and
Second Defendants to pay our Client's costs on the standard basis. In view of what we have
set out above and in earlier correspondence, we anticipate that the First and Second
Defendants would need to agree with each other what proportion of the Claimant's costs each
of them would bear. They have brought these proceedings upon themselves, and must bear
the costs consequences of their actions.
If your Clients are minded to accept our Client's Offer, but are concerned with our drafting,
please raise those concerns with us, as we would not wish any drafting difficulties to stand in
the way of a settlement.
With a view to ascertaining whether one, some or all of the unrepresented Defendants are
willing to agree a settlement in the terms proposed by our Client, we shall today send to each
of them a copy of this letter and of the draft Minute of Order.
with
In light of the forthcoming Trial and of the need to deliver a Brief to Counsel
associated costs consequences - we look forward to hearing from you in response as a matter
of urgency.
Page 3 of 4
Page 97 of 140
As will be evident from the heading of this letter, it is written on a "Without Prejudice Save
As To Costs" basis, and in the event of our Client's Offer being rejected he reserves the right
to refer to its contents when the question of costs falls to be dealt with at the conclusion of the
forthcoming Trial.
Yours faithfully,
BEVISS & BECKINGSALE

Explanatory Notes
The following notes are supplied for assistance in making the application overleaf. Detailed information
for the making of all kinds of applications to the Land Charges Department is contained in Practice
Guide 63 - Land Charges - Applications for registration, official search, office copy and cancellation
which is obtainable on application at the address shown below.
1. Fees must be paid by Direct Debit under an authorised agreement with Land Registry or by cheque or
postal order made payable to âLand Registry" (see the Practice Guide referred to above).
2. The application can be typed or handwritten in black ink. If handwritten, block capitals should be
used.
3. Please enter the full name and address of each person entitled to the benefit of the charge and on
whose behalf the application is being made.
4. This form is for use in registering any one of the following classes or sub-classes of land charge, as
specified in s.2 of the Land Charges Act 1972:
Class A
Class B
-
Class C(i) puisne mortgage
-
Class C(ii) limited owner's charge
Class C(iii) - general equitable charge
Class C(iv) estate contract
-
Class D(i) inland revenue charge
Class D(ii) restrictive covenant
Class D(iii) equitable easement
NB. To register a land charge of Class F (rights of a spouse or civil partner to occupy the matrimonial or
civil partnership home) use printed form K2. To register a Pending Action use printed form K3 and, for
a Writ or Order, printed form K4.
5. Enter the names of the administrative county and district or unitary authority area in which the land
is situated. This must be the appropriate name as set out in Practice Guide 63 â Land Charges -
Applications for registration, official search, office copy and cancellation. In London, enter
"Greater Londonâ as the county name and the London Borough as that of the district. A short
description identifying the location of the land must also be supplied; for urban properties the postal
address will usually suffice. In other cases the description should be supplied as given in the
instrument. When this does not provide a description which identifies the location of the land, an
additional reference may be made to the land as being that defined on a plan to the instrument, but
the plan should not accompany the application.
6. A separate form is required for each estate owner against whom the land charge is to be registered.
Thus, when two persons are joint estate owners, two separate forms K1 must be supplied. âEstate
owner" is defined in s.205 of the Law of Property Act 1925.
In the case of individuals, forenames must be separated from surname and each entered in the spaces
provided. In the case of a corporate body, no such distinction arises and the printed words
"Forename(s)" and "Surname" should be deleted before entering in the spaces the corporate name in
its ordinary form (eg, âBlankshire County Council", "John Brown and Company Limited").
7. If you have been allocated a key number, please take care to enter this in the space provided
overleaf, whether or not you are paying fees by Direct Debit.
8. Any reference should be limited to 25 characters (including oblique strokes and punctuation).
9. An application will be rejected if it is not signed or if the certificate that it does not affect registered
land has been deleted. However, in a case of extreme urgency, where it is not practicable for the
applicant first to ascertain whether or not the land is registered, the Department will accept an
application with the certificate deleted provided that it is accompanied by a letter to the following
effect. The letter must certify that the applicant has applied for an official search of the index map at
the appropriate Land Registry office. It must also contain an undertaking that he will apply to cancel
this registration if the result of search shows that the title to the land is registered.
10. When completed, this application form should be despatched to the address shown below which is
printed in a position to fit within a standard window envelope.
