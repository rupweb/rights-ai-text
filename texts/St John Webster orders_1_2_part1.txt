Before His Honour Judge McCahill QC sitting at Bristol District Registry, Bristol Civil Justice Centre, 2 Redcliff
Street, Bristol, BS1 6GR.
Upon consider the claim form, supporting bundle of documents, and application of the Claimant, Mr Webster
IT IS ORDERED THAT
1. Any application concerning a witness statement in claim A00TA241 should be dealt with in Taunton County
Court. Any application for extension of time should be made in that court where the claim is proceeding. This
court does not hold the file for the Taunton proceedings.
REGI
renewa
2. Mr Webster has issued a new claim in Bristol on 2nd March 2015 (B30BS107). The part 7 particulars of claim
which has been issued suggests a removal of the claim dismissed by HHJ Purle QC. Their relationship with the
Taunton proceedings is not clear. There is now a multiplicity of proceedings issued by Mr Webster in London,
Bristol and Taunton. There is an issue whether Mr Webster is abusing the process of the court.
3.As far as asking my permission to enable Mr Webster to apply to the Land Registry is concerned, Mr Webster
should first ask the other side (Clarke Willmott) whether they oppose any amendments or variation of my injunction.
It is not immediately apparent that Mr Webster was actually evicted or that he already has 10 years adverse
possession. Have the Executors claimed that Mr Webster WAS evicted on 10th September 2014?
4. Against a background of suggested abuse of process, I am not willing to vary the injunction on paper to grant
permission to make another claim. Mr Webster must first raise the matter with the Executors.
5. Executors to file evidence in Reply by 10:00AM on Monday 9th March 2015, specifically addressing the time
limit under LRA 2002, schedule 6, to be immediately referred to HHJ McCahill QC.
6. No further evidence to be filed.
The court office at Bristol District Registry, Bristol Civil Justice Centre, 2 Redcliff Street, Bristol, BS1 6GR is open between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Monday to Friday.

7. List before HHJ McCahill QC, at 11:00AM on Monday 23rd March 2015, with a time estimate of 2 hours in
addition to the hearing listed at 2:00PM. 1 hour is an inadequate time estimate to deal with these applications by
Mr Webster.
8. The Court expresses no view on the propriety of the status of the claim issued (B30BS107). All options remain
open to the court.
